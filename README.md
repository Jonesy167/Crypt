# Crypt V1.17
Simple lightweight python 3 based program to encrypt data within text files using a custom Cryptographic algorithm designed by the author, created and tested using Python 3.6.3 x86 on Win 10 Home.

The aim of this software is to provide a robust secure solution for encrypting individual .txt files - this has many applications including attaching the encrypted txt files to emails to protect communication content, or providing a straighforward portable means to store sensitive text data localy.

The encryption algorithm is symetric so uses the same key (password) to decrypt data as is used to encrypt, further adding to its ease of use. 

Minimum password length of 16 Characters ensures that your data is secure.

ONLY THE FILE crypt V1_17.exe is needed, there is no requirement for any other files from this repo, neither is there a requirement for Python to be installed on the device as the python files have been converted to a single exe.

Simply excecute the program as you would any other Windows excecutable and follow the prompts, since this is a stand alone .exe there is no requirment to install anything on your system.
