# Crypt V1.9
Simple python 3 based program to encrypt data within text files, created and tested using Python 3.6.3 x86 on Win 10 Home.


ONLY THE FILE crypt V1_12.exe is needed, there is no requirement for any other files from this repo, neither is there a requirement for Python to be installed on the device as the python files have been converted to a single exe.
